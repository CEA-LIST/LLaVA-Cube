## 💡 Abstract

Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA³ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

## 🔍 Overview

Our pipeline consists of three main stages:

    1. Multi-view 3D LLaVA and hierarchical SAM Reconstruction: Training a Nerfacto-based NeRF that jointly learns geometry, a dense 3D LLaVA feature field and a hierarchical Instance SAM-CLIP-based feature field.

    2. Object Hierarchy Extraction: Decomposing the scene into a graph of objects, parts, and sub-parts using clustering on our hierarchical feature field and refining this graph via CLIP-based heuristics filtering.

    3. VLM-compatible Representation: converting these 3D objects into ordered 2D "Cubist" token sets that a standard VLM can understand without fine-tuning.

This set of visual tokens can then be fed to the LLaVA VLM with any textual queries.
